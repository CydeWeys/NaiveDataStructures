NaiveDataStructures
===================

This is a collection of data structures and algorithm implementations (sorts, tree traversals, that kind of thing) that I wrote for two main reasons:

1. To refresh my knowledge of Java.
2. To refresh my understanding of many data structures that I last used in university.
 
Feel free to use this for educational purposes, but I would highly recommend against using it as an actual library, because not only can I not guarantee efficiency, I can't even guarantee correctness!
